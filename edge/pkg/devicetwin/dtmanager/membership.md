1. Testing MemWorker.Start() Method
Test Case 1: Ensure the Start() method processes messages correctly from ReceiverChan.

Mock the input message to ReceiverChan and simulate receiving a *dttype.DTMessage.
Verify that the appropriate callback from memActionCallBack is triggered based on the message action (MemGet, MemUpdated, MemDetailResult).
Test that errors are logged if the callback is not found for a particular action.
Test that the loop continues and handles other messages even when one message processing fails.
Test Case 2: Ensure the Start() method handles heartbeats correctly.

Mock input to the HeartBeatChan and ensure that the HeartBeat() method of DTContext is called.
Verify that errors are logged when the heartbeat fails or there are issues with sending the heartbeat.
Test Case 3: Test graceful termination when channels are closed.

Simulate closing of ReceiverChan and HeartBeatChan and ensure that the Start() method exits without errors.
2. Testing initMemActionCallBack()
Test Case 4: Ensure the callback map is initialized correctly.
Verify that the memActionCallBack map contains the correct actions (MemGet, MemUpdated, MemDetailResult) and that they point to the correct functions (dealMembershipGet, dealMembershipUpdate, dealMembershipDetail).
3. Testing Membership Event Handlers
3.1. Testing dealMembershipGet()
Test Case 5: Ensure that dealMembershipGet() processes the MemGet event correctly.
Mock the model.Message content for MemGet and verify that it is unmarshalled correctly.
Test that the function calls dealMembershipGetInner() with the correct payload.
Ensure that errors are logged when unmarshalling fails or when there are other issues with the message content.
3.2. Testing dealMembershipUpdate()
Test Case 6: Ensure dealMembershipUpdate() correctly handles adding/removing devices.
Mock the model.Message content for MemUpdated and verify that the devices are processed correctly for both additions and removals.
Test that devices are correctly added or removed using the addDevice() and removeDevice() functions.
Verify that errors are handled and logged correctly during the device addition/removal process.
3.3. Testing dealMembershipDetail()
Test Case 7: Ensure dealMembershipDetail() processes device updates correctly.
Mock the model.Message content for MemDetailResult and verify that the devices are unmarshalled and processed correctly.
Test that devices that need to be removed are identified and removed properly.
Ensure that the addDevice() and removeDevice() methods are called correctly with the appropriate arguments.
Verify that the LockAll() and UnlockAll() methods of DTContext are correctly used.
4. Testing Device Management Methods
4.1. Testing addDevice()
Test Case 8: Ensure addDevice() adds devices correctly.

Test that devices are added to the DeviceList and DeviceMutex correctly.
Verify that the device attributes and twin data are handled properly (e.g., syncing with SQLite, retry logic).
Ensure that the device is correctly published to the edge if necessary.
Test that errors are handled, and devices are rolled back if there is a failure during the addition process.
Test Case 9: Test the behavior when a device already exists in the list.

Verify that the device is not added again if it already exists in the DeviceList.
Test that the existing device's attributes and twin data are updated correctly.
4.2. Testing removeDevice()
Test Case 10: Ensure removeDevice() removes devices correctly.

Mock the model.Message content for MemUpdated with devices to remove.
Verify that the devices are removed from DeviceList and the database (SQLite).
Ensure that devices are published to the edge after removal.
Test retry logic in case of failures during removal.
Test Case 11: Ensure that removeDevice() handles errors gracefully when the device is not found.

Verify that the method logs errors when attempting to remove a device that does not exist in the DeviceList.
5. Testing dealMembershipGetInner()
Test Case 12: Ensure dealMembershipGetInner() processes membership correctly.
Mock the payload for dealMembershipGetInner() and ensure that the devices are retrieved from the DeviceList correctly.
Verify that the function handles error cases (e.g., unmarshalling issues, empty device list).
Test that the correct response message is sent using the context.Send() method.
6. Testing Sync from SQLite
Test Case 13: Ensure SyncDeviceFromSqlite() syncs devices correctly.
Mock the SQLite queries (QueryDevice, QueryDeviceAttr, QueryDeviceTwin) to return known devices.
Test that devices are synced correctly to the DeviceList and DeviceMutex.
Ensure that errors in syncing (e.g., device not found, database errors) are handled and logged properly.
7. Error Handling & Edge Cases
Test Case 14: Ensure that error conditions are handled gracefully.

Test invalid messages being sent to ReceiverChan and ensure that errors are logged, and the system continues processing.
Simulate errors in device synchronization, heartbeat processing, and message unmarshalling to verify that the system handles them appropriately.
Test Case 15: Ensure retry logic works as expected for device addition and removal.

Test that retry attempts are made when device operations fail (e.g., adding or removing devices from SQLite).
