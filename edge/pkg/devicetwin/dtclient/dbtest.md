This file includes all the test logic for the file dbtest

## dbtest.go


1. Test Cases for Save Operation (GetCasesSave)
Setup:
Mock the beego.MockOrmer and initialize CasesSaveStr.
Scenarios:
Success Case: Ensure that DoTX executes successfully without errors.
Failure Case: Simulate DoTX returning errFailedDBOperation and ensure the function handles it properly.
Assertions:
Validate that DoTX is called.
Check that the function properly returns an error when DoTX fails.
2. Test Cases for Delete Operation (GetCasesDelete)
Setup:
Mock beego.MockOrmer and beego.MockQuerySeter.
Scenarios:
Success Case: Simulate successful deletion by returning deleteReturnInt > 0.
Failure Case: Simulate deletion failure by returning errFailedDBOperation.
Assertions:
Ensure QueryTable is called correctly.
Verify that Filter and Delete are invoked with expected parameters.
Check error handling when deletion fails.
3. Test Cases for Update Operation (GetCasesUpdate)
Setup:
Mock beego.MockOrmer and beego.MockQuerySeter.
Scenarios:
Success Case: Simulate an update that successfully affects rows (updateReturnInt > 0).
Failure Case: Simulate an update failure returning errFailedDBOperation.
Assertions:
Ensure QueryTable and Filter are called.
Validate Update method execution and error handling.
4. Test Cases for Query Operation (GetCasesQuery)
Setup:
Mock beego.MockOrmer and beego.MockQuerySeter.
Scenarios:
Success Case: Simulate a query that returns allReturnInt > 0.
Failure Case: Simulate an error during query execution.
Assertions:
Ensure QueryTable and Filter are executed.
Validate the correctness of All method calls.
Check proper error handling when All fails.
5. Test Cases for Transaction-Based Operations (GetCasesTrans)
Setup:
Mock beego.MockOrmer and beego.MockQuerySeter.
Scenarios:
Transaction Save Failure Case: Simulate failure at Insert, expect rollback.
Transaction Delete Failure Case: Simulate failure at Delete, expect rollback.
Transaction Update Fields Failure Case: Simulate failure at Update, expect rollback.
Success Case: Simulate a transaction where all operations succeed, expect commit.
Assertions:
Ensure Begin, Rollback, and Commit are called the expected number of times.
Validate Insert, Delete, and Update method executions.
Check proper error handling in failure cases.
