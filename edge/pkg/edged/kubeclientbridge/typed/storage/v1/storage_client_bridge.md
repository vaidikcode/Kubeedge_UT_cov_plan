1. Test StorageV1Bridge Initialization
Setup:
Create a mock MetaClient implementing client.CoreInterface.
Initialize StorageV1Bridge with fakestoragev1.FakeStorageV1 and the mock MetaClient.
Assertions:
Ensure the StorageV1Bridge is correctly initialized.
Ensure the MetaClient is assigned properly.
2. Test VolumeAttachments Method
Setup:
Create a StorageV1Bridge instance with a mock MetaClient.
Action:
Call VolumeAttachments().
Assertions:
Ensure the returned object is of type VolumeAttachmentsBridge.
Ensure the FakeVolumeAttachments field is correctly initialized.
Ensure MetaClient is passed correctly to VolumeAttachmentsBridge.
3. Test Mock Behavior
Setup:
Use StorageV1Bridge to retrieve VolumeAttachments().
Perform fake API operations on VolumeAttachmentsBridge (e.g., Create, Get, List).
Assertions:
Ensure interactions happen through the fake client without actual API calls.
Verify if MetaClient is utilized when expected.
