## Test Logic for CertManager Implementation


To test the CertManager component, the following test cases should be covered:

1. Initialization Tests
Verify CertManager Initialization
Ensure CertManager is created with correct configuration values from EdgeHub.
Validate that the default values (like now function) are set properly.
2. Certificate Retrieval Tests
Verify getCurrent() with Existing Certificate

Check if getCurrent() successfully loads the certificate and parses it.
Validate that the certificate fields (e.g., NotAfter, NotBefore) are correctly retrieved.
Verify getCurrent() with Missing Certificate

Simulate missing or invalid certificate files.
Ensure getCurrent() returns an appropriate error.
3. Certificate Application Tests
Verify applyCerts() When No Valid Certificate Exists

Ensure applyCerts() fetches CA certificates correctly.
Validate that applyCerts() calls GetEdgeCert() to generate a new certificate.
Confirm that the generated certificate and key are stored correctly.
Verify applyCerts() with Token Validation

Ensure VerifyCAAndGetRealToken() correctly validates the token before applying certificates.
4. Certificate Rotation Tests
Verify rotate() Starts Rotation Process

Check if rotate() triggers the rotateCert() function at the correct interval.
Ensure proper backoff logic is applied when rotation fails.
Verify nextRotationDeadline() Computes Correct Deadline

Ensure the deadline is calculated using the certificateâ€™s NotBefore and NotAfter fields.
Validate jitter is applied correctly.
Verify rotateCert() Generates and Stores New Certificates

Simulate a scenario where rotateCert() is triggered.
Ensure it successfully generates a new certificate.
Validate that the new certificate is written to the appropriate files.
Verify rotateCert() Handles Rotation Failure Gracefully

Simulate network failures when requesting a new certificate.
Ensure that retry mechanisms and backoff strategies are correctly applied.
5. CA Certificate Retrieval Tests
Verify getCA() Reads the CA File Successfully

Ensure getCA() reads the CA file and returns the expected content.
Verify GetCACert() Fetches Certificate from CloudCore

Simulate a successful HTTP response and verify that CA certificates are correctly fetched.
Ensure proper error handling when fetching fails (e.g., network errors, invalid responses).
6. Edge Certificate Request Tests
Verify GetEdgeCert() Successfully Requests Certificates

Ensure it correctly generates a CSR (Certificate Signing Request).
Validate that GetEdgeCert() sends a proper HTTP request to CloudCore.
Check that the received certificate is correctly parsed and stored.
Verify GetEdgeCert() Handles HTTP Errors Gracefully

Simulate HTTP failures and validate the function returns appropriate errors.
7. Start Function Tests
Verify Start() Calls Correct Methods
Ensure getCurrent() is called initially.
Validate that applyCerts() is triggered when no valid certificate is found.
Check if certificate rotation is started when RotateCertificates is enabled.
