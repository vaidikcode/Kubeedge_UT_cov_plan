Test Logic for podStatus Implementation
1. Test newPodStatus
Objective: Verify that newPodStatus() correctly initializes a podStatus instance.
Steps:
Call newPodStatus() with a namespace and a mock SendInterface.
Ensure the returned instance is not nil.
Validate that namespace and send properties are correctly assigned.
2. Test Create
Objective: Since Create() is unimplemented (returns nil, nil), confirm expected behavior.
Steps:
Call Create() with a sample PodStatusRequest.
Ensure the function returns nil, nil.
3. Test Update
Objective: Validate that Update() sends a correctly formatted update request and handles responses properly.
Test Cases:
Successful Update:
Mock SendSync() to return a response with constants.MessageSuccessfulContent.
Verify that the function returns nil (indicating success).
Failure in Sending Request:
Simulate an error in SendSync().
Ensure the function returns an appropriate error message.
Invalid Response Content:
Simulate a response with an unexpected content type.
Ensure the function returns an appropriate error message.
4. Test Delete
Objective: Since Delete() is unimplemented (returns nil), confirm expected behavior.
Steps:
Call Delete() with a sample pod name.
Ensure the function returns nil.
5. Test Get
Objective: Since Get() is unimplemented (returns nil, nil), confirm expected behavior.
Steps:
Call Get() with a sample pod name.
Ensure the function returns nil, nil.
