## Test Logic for nodeStatus Implementation

1. Test newNodeStatus
Objective: Verify that newNodeStatus() correctly initializes a nodeStatus instance.
Steps:
Call newNodeStatus() with a namespace and a mock SendInterface.
Ensure the returned instance is not nil.
Validate that the namespace and send properties are correctly assigned.
2. Test Create (Placeholder)
Objective: Since Create() is currently unimplemented, ensure it returns nil, nil.
Steps:
Call Create() with a NodeStatusRequest object.
Verify the returned values are nil, nil.
3. Test Update
Objective: Validate that Update() correctly formats the message and handles responses.
Test Cases:
Successful Update:
Provide a valid NodeStatusRequest object.
Simulate a successful response from SendSync().
Ensure no error is returned.
Failed Update:
Provide a NodeStatusRequest object.
Simulate an error response from SendSync().
Verify that the correct error message is returned.
4. Test Delete (Placeholder)
Objective: Since Delete() is currently unimplemented, ensure it returns nil.
Steps:
Call Delete() with a node status name.
Verify that nil is returned.
5. Test Get (Placeholder)
Objective: Since Get() is currently unimplemented, ensure it returns nil, nil.
Steps:
Call Get() with a node status name.
Verify the returned values are nil, nil.
General Considerations
Mock SendSync() to simulate different responses (success and failure).
Check message format in Update():
Ensure MetaGroup, EdgedModuleName, and the resource path are correctly set.
Verify the operation type is UpdateOperation.
Error handling validation in Update().
