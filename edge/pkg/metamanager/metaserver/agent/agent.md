## All test Cases for agent

---

### **1. `NewApplicationAgent()`**
- **Valid Case:**  
  - Call `NewApplicationAgent()` and ensure the returned object is not `nil`.  
  - Verify that `watchSyncQueue` is initialized.  
  - Ensure `GC()` and `watchSync()` run as background goroutines.  

---

### **2. `Generate(ctx context.Context, verb metaserver.ApplicationVerb, option interface{}, obj runtime.Object)`**
- **Valid Case:**  
  - Simulate a connected state (`connect.IsConnected() == true`).  
  - Generate an application and ensure it is stored in `Applications`.  
  - Verify the `Identifier()` is correctly assigned.  
- **Invalid Case:**  
  - Simulate a disconnected state (`connect.IsConnected() == false`) and ensure it returns `ErrConnectionLost`.  
  - Provide an invalid `ctx` and ensure it returns an error.  
  - Ensure creating an application with an invalid key returns an error.  

---

### **3. `Apply(app *metaserver.Application)`**
- **Valid Case:**  
  - Insert an application into `Applications` and call `Apply()`.  
  - Ensure `doApply()` is triggered when the status is `PreApplying` or `Completed`.  
  - Verify that an `Approved` application returns `nil` without processing.  
- **Invalid Case:**  
  - Try applying an application that is not registered in `Applications` and expect an error.  
  - Ensure applying a `Rejected` application returns an error.  
  - Ensure applying a `Failed` application returns an error with the correct failure reason.  

---

### **4. `doApply(app *metaserver.Application)`**
- **Valid Case:**  
  - Ensure the application’s status is updated to `InApplying`.  
  - Simulate a successful response from `beehiveContext.SendSync()` and verify that the application is updated with the correct status, reason, and response body.  
- **Invalid Case:**  
  - Simulate a timeout or failure in `beehiveContext.SendSync()` and ensure the application status is updated to `Failed`.  
  - Ensure malformed responses from `MsgToApplication()` result in an appropriate failure reason.  

---

### **5. `CloseApplication(appID string)`**
- **Valid Case:**  
  - Insert an application, then call `CloseApplication()`.  
  - Ensure the application is removed from `Applications`.  
  - Verify `SyncWatchAppOnConnected()` is triggered.  
- **Invalid Case:**  
  - Attempt to close an application that doesn’t exist and ensure no error occurs.  

---

### **6. `GC()` (Garbage Collection)**
- **Valid Case:**  
  - Insert an application with a `LastCloseTime()` older than 5 minutes.  
  - Call `GC()` and ensure the application is removed.  
- **Invalid Case:**  
  - Ensure that applications without a `LastCloseTime()` are not deleted.  
  - Verify that applications closed less than 5 minutes ago remain in `Applications`.  

---

### **7. `SyncWatchAppOnConnected()`**
- **Valid Case:**  
  - Call `SyncWatchAppOnConnected()` and verify that `"SyncWatchApp"` is added to `watchSyncQueue`.  

---

### **8. `watchSync()`**
- **Valid Case:**  
  - Ensure `processNextWorkItem()` is repeatedly called until the queue is empty.  

---

### **9. `processNextWorkItem()`**
- **Valid Case:**  
  - Simulate a valid item in `watchSyncQueue`, call `processNextWorkItem()`, and ensure `syncWatchApplications()` is triggered.  
  - Ensure that if `syncWatchApplications()` succeeds, the queue forgets the key.  
- **Invalid Case:**  
  - Simulate `syncWatchApplications()` failing and ensure the key is re-added with rate limiting.  
  - Ensure that if `watchSyncQueue.Get()` returns `quit`, the function returns `false`.  

---

### **10. `syncWatchApplications()`**
- **Valid Case:**  
  - Insert multiple watch applications and call `syncWatchApplications()`.  
  - Ensure `beehiveContext.SendSync()` is called with the correct message.  
  - Verify that applications are correctly serialized before sending.  
- **Invalid Case:**  
  - Simulate `SendSync()` failure and ensure the error is logged.  
  - Simulate an invalid response from `MsgToApplications()` and ensure an error is logged.  

---

### **11. `listWatchApplications()`**
- **Valid Case:**  
  - Insert applications with various verbs and call `listWatchApplications()`.  
  - Ensure only applications with `verb == metaserver.Watch` are returned.  
- **Invalid Case:**  
  - Ensure an empty `Applications` map returns an empty result.
