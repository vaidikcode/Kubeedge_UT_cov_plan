## Test Plan for NewRequestScope Function

1. Initialization & Object Creation
Verify that NewRequestScope() returns a non-nil RequestScope object.
Ensure that all fields in the RequestScope struct are properly initialized.
Check that typeConverter and fieldManager are successfully created.
2. Error Handling
Simulate a failure in managedfields.NewTypeConverter() and check if the function logs an error and returns nil.
Simulate a failure in managedfields.NewDefaultFieldManager() and verify the error handling behavior.
3. FieldManager Initialization
Ensure that fieldManager is correctly instantiated with:
A valid TypeConverter
A FakeObjectConvertor
A FakeObjectDefaulter
An UnstructuredCreator
Properly set GroupVersionKind and GroupVersion
4. RequestScope Field Validations
Namer: Ensure handlers.ContextBasedNaming is initialized with meta.NewAccessor() and ClusterScoped: false.
Serializer: Validate that serializer.NewNegotiatedSerializer() is correctly assigned.
ParameterCodec: Check that it is set to scheme.ParameterCodec.
StandardSerializers: Ensure it is an empty slice.
Creater, Convertor, Defaulter, Typer: Validate that these fields are assigned to their respective fakers or unstructuredscheme components.
UnsafeConvertor: Ensure it is assigned fakers.NewFakeObjectConvertor().
Authorizer: Verify that fakers.NewAlwaysAllowAuthorizer() is used.
EquivalentResourceMapper: Ensure runtime.NewEquivalentResourceRegistry() is initialized properly.
TableConvertor: Check that rest.NewDefaultTableConvertor(schema.GroupResource{}) is assigned.
Resource & Kind: Validate that they are initialized as empty GroupVersionResource and GroupVersionKind structs.
AcceptsGroupVersionDelegate & Subresource: Ensure they are set to nil and an empty string, respectively.
MetaGroupVersion & HubGroupVersion: Confirm that they are initialized correctly.
MaxRequestBodyBytes: Verify that it is set to 3 * 1024 * 1024 (3 MB).
5. Default Behaviors
Ensure NewRequestScope() can be called multiple times without issues.
Verify that calling NewRequestScope() always returns a new instance.
This test plan ensures correctness, error handling, and proper initialization of NewRequestScope().
