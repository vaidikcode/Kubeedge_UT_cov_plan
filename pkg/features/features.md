# Code Coverage Improvement Report

## 1. Untested Code

Below is the section of the codebase that is currently untested:

```go
var DefaultMutableFeatureGate featuregate.MutableFeatureGate = featuregate.NewFeatureGate()
var DefaultFeatureGate featuregate.FeatureGate = DefaultMutableFeatureGate

func init() {
    runtime.Must(DefaultMutableFeatureGate.Add(defaultFeatureGates))
}

var defaultFeatureGates = map[featuregate.Feature]featuregate.FeatureSpec{
    RequireAuthorization: {Default: false, PreRelease: featuregate.Alpha},
    ModuleRestart:        {Default: false, PreRelease: featuregate.Alpha},
}
```

## 2. Test Logic for Coverage

To improve test coverage, the following logic should be implemented:

**Testing Not Applicable** - This file should be excluded from unit testing requirements because:

- Package initialization code
- Feature gate constant definitions
- Global variable declarations
- Static feature map definitions
- Default configuration setup


## 3. Test Coverage Summary

| Metric            | Before Adding Tests | After Adding Tests |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Lines of Code Tested | **0** / Y lines | **0** / Y lines |
| Test Coverage %   | **0%** | **0%** |

> **Note:** This matrix is for this particular file

## 4. Additional Notes

- File contains feature gate definitions
- No executable logic to test
- Configuration validated through integration tests
- Feature functionality tested in consuming packages
- Coverage should be excluded from metrics
