# Code Coverage Improvement Report

## 1. Untested Code

Below is the section of the codebase that is currently untested:

```go
const (
    CAHandlerTypeX509 = "x509"
    HandlerTypeX509 = "x509"
)

type CAHandlerType string
type HanndlerType string

func GetCAHandler(t CAHandlerType) CAHandler {
    switch t {
    case CAHandlerTypeX509:
        return &x509CAHandler{}
    }
    return nil
}

func GetHandler(t HanndlerType) Handler {
    switch t {
    case HandlerTypeX509:
        return &x509CertsHandler{}
    }
    return nil
}
```

## 2. Test Logic for Coverage

**Testing Not Applicable** - This file should be excluded from unit testing requirements because:

- Contains only factory pattern definitions
- Type declarations and constants
- Simple handler instantiation logic
- No complex business logic
- Handler implementations tested elsewhere


## 3. Test Coverage Summary

| Metric            | Before Adding Tests | After Adding Tests |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Lines of Code Tested | **0** / 10 lines | **o** / 10 lines |
| Test Coverage %   | **0%** | **%** |

> **Note:** This matrix is for this particular file

## 4. Additional Notes

- File contains factory pattern implementation
- Handler implementations tested in respective files
- Constants and type definitions
- Coverage should be excluded from metrics
- Functionality verified through handler tests
