# Code Coverage Improvement Report

## 1. Untested Code

Below is the section of the codebase that is currently untested and does not require unit tests:

```go
var edgeEditShortDescription = `Edit a specific resource`

// NewEdgeEdit returns KubeEdge edit edge resources command.
func NewEdgeEdit() *cobra.Command {
 cmd := &cobra.Command{
  Use:   "edit",
  Short: edgeEditShortDescription,
  Long:  edgeEditShortDescription,
 }
 cmd.AddCommand(NewEdgeEditDevice())
 return cmd
}
```

## 2. Test Logic for Coverage

No unit tests are required for the above code.

## 3. Test Coverage Summary

| Metric                | Before Adding Tests | After Adding Tests |
|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Lines of Code Tested  | **0** / **20** lines | **0** / **20** lines |
| Test Coverage %       | **0%**              | **0%**             |

> **Note:** This matrix is for the `edit.go` file.

## 4. Additional Notes

- The `NewEdgeEdit` function and related code are not critical for the current coverage goal and can be excluded from testing.
