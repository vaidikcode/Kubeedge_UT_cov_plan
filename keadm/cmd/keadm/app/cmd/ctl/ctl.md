# Code Coverage Improvement Report

## 1. Untested Code

Below is the section of the codebase that is currently untested:

```go
// File Path: keadm/cmd/keadm/app/cmd/ctl/ctl.go
package ctl

var ctlShortDescription = `Commands operating on the data plane at edge`

// NewCtl returns KubeEdge edge pod command.
func NewCtl() *cobra.Command {
	cmd := &cobra.Command{
		Use:   "ctl",
		Short: ctlShortDescription,
		Long:  ctlShortDescription,
	}

	cmd.AddCommand(get.NewEdgeGet())
	cmd.AddCommand(restart.NewEdgeRestart())
	cmd.AddCommand(confirm.NewEdgeConfirm())
	cmd.AddCommand(logs.NewEdgePodLogs())
	cmd.AddCommand(exec.NewEdgePodExec())
	cmd.AddCommand(describe.NewEdgeDescribe())
	cmd.AddCommand(edit.NewEdgeEdit())
	return cmd
}
```

## 2. Test Logic for Coverage

No tests are required for this file as it primarily consists of command registration logic.

## 3. Test Coverage Summary

| Metric                | Before Adding Tests | After Adding Tests |
|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Lines of Code Tested  | **0** / **0** lines | **0** / **0** lines |
| Test Coverage %       | **0%**              | **0%**             |

> **Note:** This matrix is for the `ctl.go` file.

## 4. Additional Notes

- No unit tests are required for this file as it primarily consists of command registration logic.
