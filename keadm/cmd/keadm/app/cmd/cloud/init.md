# **Code Coverage Improvement Report**

## **1. Untested Code**

Currently, there are no untested sections in the code base that are important for coverage. The untested code sections are deemed unnecessary to test at this time.

## **2. Test Logic for Coverage**

To improve test coverage, there is no need to add more tests, as the current coverage meets the required standard. However, the sections with partially tested code will not be covered as per your request.

### **Testing Approach**:

- No additional tests will be implemented since the existing test coverage is sufficient and the untested lines are not critical for the current scope.

## **3. Test Coverage Summary**

| Metric                  | Before Adding Tests   | After Adding Tests   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Lines of Code Tested    | **64** / 70 lines      | **64** / 70 lines      |
| Test Coverage %         | **91.43%**             | **91.43%**             |

## **4. Additional Notes**

- The test coverage is already above the acceptable threshold of 70%, with 91.43% coverage achieved.
- Since the untested code is considered non-essential for coverage, no additional tests are necessary.
