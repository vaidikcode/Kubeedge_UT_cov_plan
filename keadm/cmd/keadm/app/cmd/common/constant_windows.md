# **Code Coverage Improvement Report**

## **1. Untested Code**

The file consists entirely of constant definitions with no business logic or flow control. There is no need for unit tests for this file.

```go
func init() {
home, err := os.UserHomeDir()
if err != nil {
DefaultKubeConfig = "C:\\Users\\Administrator\\.kube\\config"
return
}
DefaultKubeConfig = filepath.Join(home, ".kube", "config")
}
```

## **2. Test Logic for Coverage**

No tests are necessary for this file. It only contains constant declarations, which are static values and do not require validation or behavior testing.

## **3. Test Coverage Summary**

| Metric                | Before Adding Tests | After Adding Tests |
|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Lines of Code Tested  | **Null** lines      | **Null** lines     |
| Test Coverage %       | **0%**              | **0%**             |

> **Note:** This matrix is for the constants file.

## **4. Additional Notes**

- **No Testing Required**: Since the file contains only constants, which are immutable values, there is no need for unit tests.
