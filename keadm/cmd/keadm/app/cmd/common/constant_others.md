```go
package constants

const (
...
```

## **2. Test Logic for Coverage**

No tests are necessary for this file. It only contains constant declarations, which are static values and do not require validation or behavior testing.

## **3. Test Coverage Summary**

| Metric                | Before Adding Tests | After Adding Tests |
