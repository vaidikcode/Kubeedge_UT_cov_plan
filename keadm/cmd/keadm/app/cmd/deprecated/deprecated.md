# Code Coverage Improvement Report

## 1. Untested Code

The following sections of the codebase are currently untested:

- `NewDeprecated` function

## 2. Test Logic for Coverage

To achieve coverage above 80%, the following unit tests should be added:

1. **NewDeprecated Function:**
    - Test the creation of the `cobra.Command` object.
    - Verify that the `Use`, `Short`, and `Long` fields are correctly set.
    - Ensure that all subcommands (`NewDeprecatedCloudInit`, `NewDeprecatedEdgeJoin`, `NewDeprecatedKubeEdgeReset`) are added correctly.

## 3. Test Coverage Summary

| Metric                | Before Adding Tests  | After Adding Tests    |
|-----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Lines of Code Tested  | **0** / **14** lines | **14** / **14** lines |
| Test Coverage %       | **0%**               | **0%**                |

> **Note:** This matrix is for the `deprecated.go` file.

## 4. Additional Notes

- The goal is to reach a test coverage percentage above 80% in every report.
