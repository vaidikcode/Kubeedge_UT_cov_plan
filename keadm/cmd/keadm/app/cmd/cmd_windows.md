# Code Coverage Improvement Report

## 1. Untested Code

Below is the section of the codebase that is currently untested:

```go
func NewKubeedgeCommand() *cobra.Command {
	cmds := &cobra.Command{
		Use:     "keadm",
		Short:   "keadm: Bootstrap KubeEdge cluster",
		Long:    keadmLongDescription,
		Example: keadmExample,
	}

	cmds.ResetFlags()

	cmds.AddCommand(NewCmdVersion())

	// recommended cmds
	cmds.AddCommand(edge.NewEdgeJoin())
	cmds.AddCommand(NewKubeEdgeReset())

	// beta cmds
	//cmds.AddCommand(edge.NewEdgeUpgrade())

	return cmds
}
```

## 2. Test Logic for Coverage

To improve test coverage, the following logic should be implemented:

- **Test that the `keadm` command is initialized correctly.**
    - Ensure the command has the correct flags and description (e.g., `Short`, `Long`, `Example`).
    - Verify that the subcommands `NewCmdVersion()`, `edge.NewEdgeJoin()`, and `NewKubeEdgeReset()` are correctly added to the `keadm` command.

- **Test that recommended commands are added.**
    - Ensure that commands like `edge.NewEdgeJoin()` are correctly associated with the `keadm` command.

- **Test the disabled beta command (commented-out line).**
    - Verify that the `edge.NewEdgeUpgrade()` command is not added because it is commented out.

- **Testing Approach:**
    - Use assertions to check the presence of each subcommand and verify its correct association with the `keadm` command.
    - Test for the absence of the `edge.NewEdgeUpgrade()` command due to it being commented out.

## 3. Test Coverage Summary

| Metric            | Before Adding Tests | After Adding Tests |

## 4. Additional Notes

- The unit tests for `NewKubeedgeCommand` should focus on verifying that:
    - The expected commands are correctly associated with the `keadm` main command.
    - The `edge.NewEdgeUpgrade()` command is excluded (since it is commented out).
- Use assertions to verify the presence of each subcommand and test the command setup.
