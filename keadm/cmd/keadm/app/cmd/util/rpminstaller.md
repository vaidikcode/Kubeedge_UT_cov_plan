# Code Coverage Improvement Report

## 1. Untested Code

Below is the section of the codebase that is currently untested:

```go
type RpmOS struct {
    KubeEdgeVersion semver.Version
    IsEdgeNode      bool
}

func (r *RpmOS) SetKubeEdgeVersion(version semver.Version)
func (r *RpmOS) InstallMQTT() error
func (r *RpmOS) IsK8SComponentInstalled(kubeConfig, master string) error
func (r *RpmOS) InstallKubeEdge(options types.InstallOptions) error
func (r *RpmOS) RunEdgeCore() error
func (r *RpmOS) KillKubeEdgeBinary(proc string) error
func (r *RpmOS) IsKubeEdgeProcessRunning(proc string) (bool, error)
func getOSVendorName() (string, error)
```

## 2. Test Logic for Coverage

**Testing Not Applicable** - This file should be excluded from unit testing requirements because:

- RPM-based OS specific package management
- System-level operations requiring root access
- Direct interaction with package manager (yum)
- Process management operations
- System service operations



## 3. Test Coverage Summary

| Metric            | Before Adding Tests | After Adding Tests |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Lines of Code Tested | **0** / 52 lines | **NA** / 52 lines |
| Test Coverage %   | **0%** | **NA%** |

> **Note:** This matrix is for this particular file

## 4. Additional Notes

- File contains RPM-based OS specific implementations
- Requires actual RPM-based Linux environment
- Should be verified through integration testing
- Coverage should be excluded from project metrics
- Functions interact with yum package manager
