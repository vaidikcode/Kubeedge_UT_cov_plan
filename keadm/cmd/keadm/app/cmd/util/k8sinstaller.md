# Code Coverage Improvement Report

## 1. Untested Code

Below is the section of the codebase that is currently untested:

```go
type K8SInstTool struct {
    Common
}

func (ks *K8SInstTool) InstallTools() error
func (ks *K8SInstTool) TearDown() error
func createKubeEdgeNs(kubeConfig, master string) error
func installCRDs(ks *K8SInstTool) error
func createKubeEdgeV1CRD(dynamicClient dynamic.Interface, crdFile string) error
```

## 2. Test Logic for Coverage

**Testing Not Applicable** - This file should be excluded from unit testing requirements because:

-Kubernetes cluster interaction
- CRD installation and management
- Dynamic client operations
- Namespace management
- System-level file operations


## 3. Test Coverage Summary

| Metric            | Before Adding Tests | After Adding Tests |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Lines of Code Tested | **0** / 129 lines | **NA** / 129 lines |
| Test Coverage %   | **0%** | **NA%** |

> **Note:** This matrix is for this particular file

## 4. Additional Notes

- File contains Kubernetes installation logic
- Requires actual Kubernetes cluster
- Should be verified through integration/E2E testing
- Coverage should be excluded from project metrics
- Functions interact with Kubernetes API server
