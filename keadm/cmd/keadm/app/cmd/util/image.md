# Code Coverage Improvement Report

## 1. Untested Code

Below is the section of the codebase that is currently untested:

```go
type ContainerRuntime interface {
    PullImages(images []string) error
    PullImage(image string, authConfig *runtimeapi.AuthConfig, sandboxConfig *runtimeapi.PodSandboxConfig) error
    CopyResources(edgeImage string, files map[string]string) error
    RunMQTT(mqttImage string) error
    RemoveMQTT() error
    GetImageDigest(image string) (string, error)
}

type CRIRuntime struct {
    endpoint            string
    cgroupDriver        string
    ImageManagerService internalapi.ImageManagerService
    RuntimeService      internalapi.RuntimeService
    ctx                 context.Context
}

// ... other methods implementation
```

## 2. Test Logic for Coverage

To improve test coverage, the following logic should be implemented:

**Testing Not Applicable** - This file should be excluded from unit testing requirements because:

- Container runtime interface implementation
- Requires actual container runtime (CRI) environment
- Direct interaction with container services
- System-level operations with privileged access
- Real image pulling and container management


## 3. Test Coverage Summary

| Metric            | Before Adding Tests | After Adding Tests |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Lines of Code Tested | **0** / 215 lines | **NA** / 215 lines |
| Test Coverage %   | **0%** | **NA%** |

> **Note:** This matrix is for this particular file

## 4. Additional Notes

- File contains CRI implementation
- Requires container runtime environment
-Should be verified through integration testing
- Coverage should be excluded from project metrics
- Functions interact with container runtime services
