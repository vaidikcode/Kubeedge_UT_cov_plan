# Code Coverage Improvement Report

## 1. Untested Code

Below is the section of the codebase that is currently untested:

```go
type MQTTInstTool struct {
    Common
}

func (m *MQTTInstTool) InstallTools() error
func (m *MQTTInstTool) TearDown() error
```

## 2. Test Logic for Coverage

**Testing Not Applicable** - This file should be excluded from unit testing requirements because:

- MQTT installation management
- System-level package operations
- OS-specific implementations
- Service management operations
- System interface interactions



## 3. Test Coverage Summary

| Metric            | Before Adding Tests | After Adding Tests |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Lines of Code Tested | **0** / 9 lines | **NA** / 9 lines |
| Test Coverage %   | **0%** | **NA%** |

> **Note:** This matrix is for this particular file

## 4. Additional Notes

- File contains MQTT installation logic
- Requires actual system environment
- Should be verified through integration testing
- Coverage should be excluded from project metrics
- Functions interact with system package manager
