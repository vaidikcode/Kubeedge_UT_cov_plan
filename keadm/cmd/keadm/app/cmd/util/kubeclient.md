# Code Coverage Improvement Report

## 1. Untested Code

Below is the section of the codebase that is currently untested:

```go
func kubeConfig(kubeconfigPath string) (conf *rest.Config, err error)
func KubeClient(kubeConfigPath string) (*kubernetes.Clientset, error)
func (co *Common) CleanNameSpace(ns, kubeConfigPath string) error
func IsCloudcoreContainerRunning(ns, kubeConfigPath string) (bool, error)
```

## 2. Test Logic for Coverage

To improve test coverage, the following logic should be implemented:


**Testing Not Applicable** - This file should be excluded from unit testing requirements because:

- Kubernetes client implementation
- Direct interaction with Kubernetes API server
- Requires actual cluster configuration
- Namespace management operations
- Pod management operations



## 3. Test Coverage Summary

| Metric            | Before Adding Tests | After Adding Tests |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Lines of Code Tested | **0** / 35 lines | **NA** / 135 lines |
| Test Coverage %   | **0%** | **NA%** |

> **Note:** This matrix is for this particular file

## 4. Additional Notes

- File contains Kubernetes client operations
- Requires actual Kubernetes cluster
- Should be verified through integration testing
- Coverage should be excluded from project metrics
- Functions interact with Kubernetes API server
