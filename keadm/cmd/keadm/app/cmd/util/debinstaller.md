# Code Coverage Improvement Report

## 1. Untested Code

Below is the section of the codebase that is currently untested:

```go
type DebOS struct {
    KubeEdgeVersion semver.Version
    IsEdgeNode      bool
}

func (d *DebOS) SetKubeEdgeVersion(version semver.Version)
func (d *DebOS) InstallMQTT() error
func (d *DebOS) IsK8SComponentInstalled(kubeConfig, master string) error
func (d *DebOS) InstallKubeEdge(options types.InstallOptions) error
func (d *DebOS) RunEdgeCore() error
func (d *DebOS) KillKubeEdgeBinary(proc string) error
func (d *DebOS) IsKubeEdgeProcessRunning(proc string) (bool, error)
```

## 2. Test Logic for Coverage

To improve test coverage, the following logic should be implemented:

**Testing Not Applicable** - This file should be excluded from unit testing requirements because:

- Debian/Ubuntu-specific package management
- System-level operations requiring root access
- Direct interaction with apt package manager
- Process management operations
- File system operations in protected directories


## 3. Test Coverage Summary

| Metric            | Before Adding Tests | After Adding Tests |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Lines of Code Tested | **0** / 30 lines | **NA** / 30 lines |
| Test Coverage %   | **0%** | **NA%** |

> **Note:** This matrix is for this particular file

## 4. Additional Notes

- File contains Debian-specific implementations
- Requires actual Debian/Ubuntu environment
- Should be verified through integration/E2E testing
- Coverage should be excluded from project metrics
- Functions interact with system package manager and services
