# Code Coverage Improvement Report

## 1. Untested Code

Below is the section of the codebase that is currently untested:

```go
func NewResetOptions() *common.ResetOptions
func RemoveMqttContainer(endpoint, cgroupDriver string) error
func RemoveContainers(criSocketPath string, execer utilsexec.Interface) error
func CleanDirectories(isEdgeNode bool) error
```

## 2. Test Logic for Coverage

**Testing Not Applicable** - This file should be excluded from unit testing requirements because:

System cleanup operations requiring root access
Container runtime interactions
Direct filesystem operations
System directory management
Process termination operations



## 3. Test Coverage Summary

| Metric            | Before Adding Tests | After Adding Tests |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Lines of Code Tested | **0** / 45 lines | **NA** / 45 lines |
| Test Coverage %   | **0%** | **NA%** |

> **Note:** This matrix is for this particular file

## 4. Additional Notes

- File contains system cleanup operations
- Requires root/admin privileges
- Should be verified through integration testing
- Coverage should be excluded from project metrics
- Functions interact with container runtime and filesystem
