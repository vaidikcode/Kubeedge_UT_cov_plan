# Code Coverage Improvement Report

## 1. Untested Code

Below is the section of the codebase that is currently untested:

```go
func InstallNSSM() error
func InstallNSSMService(name, path string, args ...string) error
func IsNSSMServiceExist(service string) bool
func IsNSSMServiceRunning(service string) bool
func StartNSSMService(service string) error
func StopNSSMService(service string) error
func SetNSSMServiceStdout(service string, file string) error
func SetNSSMServiceStderr(service string, file string) error
func UninstallNSSMService(service string) error
```

## 2. Test Logic for Coverage

**Testing Not Applicable** - This file should be excluded from unit testing requirements because:

Windows-specific service management
NSSM service operations requiring admin rights
System-level command execution
Windows PowerShell script execution
Direct service management operations



## 3. Test Coverage Summary

| Metric            | Before Adding Tests | After Adding Tests |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Lines of Code Tested | **0** / 39 lines | **NA** / 39 lines |
| Test Coverage %   | **0%** | **NA%** |

> **Note:** This matrix is for this particular file

## 4. Additional Notes

- File contains Windows NSSM service management
- Requires Windows environment with admin rights
- Should be verified through integration testing
- Coverage should be excluded from project metrics
- Functions interact with Windows services
