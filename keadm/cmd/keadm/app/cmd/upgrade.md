# **Code Coverage Improvement Report**

## **1. Untested Code**

Below is the section of the codebase that is currently untested:

```go
const (
	upgradeLongDescription = `Upgrade components of the cloud or the edge.
Specify whether to upgrade the cloud or the edge through three-level commands.
If no three-level command, it upgrades edge components.`
)

// NewUpgradeCommand creates an upgrade command instance and returns it.
func NewUpgradeCommand() *cobra.Command {
	cmds := &cobra.Command{
		Use:   "upgrade",
		Short: "Upgrade components of the cloud or the edge",
		Long:  upgradeLongDescription,
	}

	// Used for backward compatibility of the edgecore triggering the upgrade command
	upgradeOptions := edge.NewUpgradeOptions()
	cmds.RunE = func(_ *cobra.Command, _ []string) error {
		return upgradeOptions.Upgrade()
	}
	edge.AddUpgradeFlags(cmds, upgradeOptions)

	// Register three-level commands
	cmds.AddCommand(edge.NewEdgeUpgrade())
	cmds.AddCommand(cloud.NewCloudUpgrade())
	return cmds
}
```

## **2. Test Logic for Coverage**

To improve test coverage, the following logic should be implemented:

- **Test the `NewUpgradeCommand` function:**
    - Test the creation of the command and ensure the correct command name, short description, and long description are set.

- **Test the `RunE` function inside the command:**
    - Test the behavior of the `RunE` function, ensuring that the `Upgrade` method from `edge.NewUpgradeOptions()` is correctly invoked.
    - Test scenarios where the `Upgrade` method is successful and where it may return an error.

- **Test the integration with the three-level commands:**
    - Test that both `edge.NewEdgeUpgrade()` and `cloud.NewCloudUpgrade()` are successfully added to the parent command.

### **Testing Approach:**
- Use Go's `testing` package to create unit tests for the `NewUpgradeCommand` function.
- Mock the `Upgrade()` method from `edge.NewUpgradeOptions()` to simulate both success and error conditions.
- Mock any interactions with the `cloud` and `edge` packages to isolate the testing of the `NewUpgradeCommand` function.

## **4. Additional Notes**

- To achieve full coverage for this file, itâ€™s essential to test the behavior of the `RunE` function and the interaction with the `upgradeOptions.Upgrade()` method.
- Mocking the integration points with `cloud.NewCloudUpgrade()` and `edge.NewEdgeUpgrade()` will allow you to test this in isolation without requiring the actual implementations of those functions.
