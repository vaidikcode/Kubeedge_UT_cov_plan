# Code Coverage Improvement Report

## 1. Untested Code  

Below is the section of the codebase that is currently untested:

```go
func main() {
	if err := app.Run(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("execute keadm command failed: ", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}
```

## 2. Test Logic for Coverage

To improve test coverage, the following logic should be implemented:

- Null
